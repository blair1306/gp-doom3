     Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing. The mode parameter
   is as in fopen (&quot;rb&quot; or &quot;wb&quot;) but can also include a compression level
   (&quot;wb9&quot;) or a strategy: &apos;f&apos; for filtered data as in &quot;wb6f&quot;, &apos;h&apos; for
   Huffman only compression as in &quot;wb1h&quot;. (See the description
   of deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.)

     gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
   case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.

     gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened or if there was
   insufficient memory to allocate the (de)compression state; errno
   can be checked to distinguish the two cases (if errno is zero, the
   zlib error is Z_MEM_ERROR).  */</doc>
