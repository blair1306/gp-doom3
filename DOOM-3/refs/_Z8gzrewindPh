      Sets the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the
   given compressed file. The offset represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream. The whence parameter is defined as in lseek(2);
   the value SEEK_END is not supported.
     If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
   extremely slow. If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
   supported; gzseek then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
   starting position.

      gzseek returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from
   the beginning of the uncompressed stream, or -1 in case of error, in
   particular if the file is opened for writing and the new starting position
   would be before the current position.
