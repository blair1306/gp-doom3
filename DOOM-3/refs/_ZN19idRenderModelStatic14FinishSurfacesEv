idRenderModelStatic::FinishSurfaces

The mergeShadows option allows surfaces with different textures to share
silhouette edges for shadow calculation, instead of leaving shared edges
hanging.

If any of the original shaders have the noSelfShadow flag set, the surfaces
can&apos;t be merged, because they will need to be drawn in different order.

If there is only one surface, a separate merged surface won&apos;t be generated.

A model with multiple surfaces can&apos;t later have a skinned shader change the
state of the noSelfShadow flag.

-----------------

Creates mirrored copies of two sided surfaces with normal maps, which would
otherwise light funny.

Extends the bounds of deformed surfaces so they don&apos;t cull incorrectly at screen edges.
