    Skips invalid compressed data until a full flush point (see above the
  description of deflate with Z_FULL_FLUSH) can be found, or until all
  available input is skipped. No output is provided.

    inflateSync returns Z_OK if a full flush point has been found, Z_BUF_ERROR
  if no more input was provided, Z_DATA_ERROR if no flush point has been found,
  or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent. In the success
  case, the application may save the current current value of total_in which
  indicates where valid compressed data was found. In the error case, the
  application may repeatedly call inflateSync, providing more input each time,
  until success or end of the input data.
