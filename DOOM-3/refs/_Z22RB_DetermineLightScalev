RB_DetermineLightScale

Sets:
backEnd.lightScale
backEnd.overBright

Find out how much we are going to need to overscale the lighting, so we
can down modulate the pre-lighting passes.

We only look at light calculations, but an argument could be made that
we should also look at surface evaluations, which would let surfaces
overbright past 1.0
