================
R_SetAlphaNormalDivergence

If any of the angles inside the cone would directly reflect to the light, there will be
a specular highlight.  The intensity of the highlight is inversely proportional to the
area of the spread.

Light source area is important for the base size.

area subtended in light is the divergence times the distance

Shininess value is subtracted from the divergence

Sets the alpha channel to the greatest divergence dot product of the surrounding texels.
1.0 = flat, 0.0 = turns a 90 degree angle
Lower values give less shiny specular
With mip maps, the lowest samnpled value will be retained

Should we rewrite the normal as the centered average?
