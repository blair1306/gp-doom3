idPlayer::AdjustHeartRate

Player heartrate works as follows

DEF_HEARTRATE is resting heartrate

Taking damage when health is above 75 adjusts heart rate by 1 beat per second
Taking damage when health is below 75 adjusts heart rate by 5 beats per second
Maximum heartrate from damage is MAX_HEARTRATE

Firing a weapon adds 1 beat per second up to a maximum of COMBAT_HEARTRATE

Being at less than 25% stamina adds 5 beats per second up to ZEROSTAMINA_HEARTRATE

All heartrates are target rates.. the heart rate will start falling as soon as there have been no adjustments for 5 seconds
Once it starts falling it always tries to get to DEF_HEARTRATE

The exception to the above rule is upon death at which point the rate is set to DYING_HEARTRATE and starts falling 
immediately to zero

Heart rate volumes go from zero ( -40 db for DEF_HEARTRATE to 5 db for MAX_HEARTRATE ) the volume is 
scaled linearly based on the actual rate

Exception to the above rule is once the player is dead, the dying heart rate starts at either the current volume if
it is audible or -10db and scales to 8db on the last few beats
