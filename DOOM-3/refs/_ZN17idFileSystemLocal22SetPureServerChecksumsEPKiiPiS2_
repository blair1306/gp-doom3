=====================
idFileSystemLocal::SetPureServerChecksums
set the pure paks according to what the server asks
if that&apos;s not possible, identify why and build an answer
can be:
  loadedFileFromDir - some files were loaded from directories instead of paks (a restart in pure pak-only is required)
  missing/wrong checksums - some pak files would need to be installed/updated (downloaded for instance)
  some pak files currently referenced are not referenced by the server
  wrong order - if the pak order doesn&apos;t match, means some stuff could have been loaded from somewhere else
server referenced files are prepended to the list if possible ( that doesn&apos;t break pureness )
DLL:
  the checksum of the pak containing the DLL is maintained seperately, the server can send different replies by OS
