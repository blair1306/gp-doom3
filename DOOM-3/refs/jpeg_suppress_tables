 * Forcibly suppress or un-suppress all quantization and Huffman tables.
 * Marks all currently defined tables as already written (if suppress)
 * or not written (if !suppress).  This will control whether they get emitted
 * by a subsequent jpeg_start_compress call.
 *
 * This routine is exported for use by applications that want to produce
 * abbreviated JPEG datastreams.  It logically belongs in jcparam.c, but
 * since it is called by jpeg_start_compress, we put it here --- otherwise
 * jcparam.o would be linked whether the application used it or not.
