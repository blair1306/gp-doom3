idRenderWorldLocal::CreateLightDefInteractions

When a lightDef is determined to effect the view (contact the frustum and non-0 light), it will check to
make sure that it has interactions for all the entityDefs that it might possibly contact.

This does not guarantee that all possible interactions for this light are generated, only that
the ones that may effect the current view are generated. so it does need to be called every view.

This does not cause entityDefs to create dynamic models, all work is done on the referenceBounds.

All entities that have non-empty interactions with viewLights will
have viewEntities made for them and be put on the viewEntity list,
even if their surfaces aren&apos;t visible, because they may need to cast shadows.

Interactions are usually removed when a entityDef or lightDef is modified, unless the change
is known to not effect them, so there is no danger of getting a stale interaction, we just need to
check that needed ones are created.

An interaction can be at several levels:

Don&apos;t interact (but share an area) (numSurfaces = 0)
Entity reference bounds touches light frustum, but surfaces haven&apos;t been generated (numSurfaces = -1)
Shadow surfaces have been generated, but light surfaces have not.  The shadow surface may still be empty due to bounds being conservative.
Both shadow and light surfaces have been generated.  Either or both surfaces may still be empty due to conservative bounds.
