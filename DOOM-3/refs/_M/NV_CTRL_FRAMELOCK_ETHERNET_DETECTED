 * NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_ETHERNET_DETECTED - The FrameLock boards are
 * cabled together using regular cat5 cable, connecting to rj45 ports
 * on the backplane of the card.  There is some concern that users may
 * think these are ethernet ports and connect them to a
 * router/hub/etc.  The hardware can detect this and will shut off to
 * prevent damage (either to itself or to the router).
 * NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_ETHERNET_DETECTED may be called to find out if
 * ethernet is connected to one of the rj45 ports.  An appropriate
 * error message should then be displayed.  The _PORT0 and PORT1
 * values may be or&apos;ed together.
