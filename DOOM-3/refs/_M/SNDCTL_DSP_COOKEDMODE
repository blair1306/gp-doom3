 * &quot;cooked&quot; mode enables software based conversions for sample rate, sample
 * format (bits) and number of channels (mono/stereo). These conversions are
 * required with some devices that support only one sample rate or just stereo
 * to let the applications to use other formats. The cooked mode is enabled by
 * default. However it&apos;s necessary to disable this mode when mmap() is used or
 * when very deterministic timing is required. SNDCTL_DSP_COOKEDMODE is an
 * optional call introduced in OSS 3.9.6f. It&apos;s _error return must be ignored_
 * since normally this call will return erno=EINVAL.
 *
 * SNDCTL_DSP_COOKEDMODE must be called immediately after open before doing
 * anything else. Otherwise the call will not have any effect.
