 * Preferred channel usage. These bits can be used to
 * give recommendations to the application. Used by few drivers.
 * For example if ((caps &amp; DSP_CH_MASK) == DSP_CH_MONO) means that
 * the device works best in mono mode. However it doesn&apos;t necessarily mean
 * that the device cannot be used in stereo. These bits should only be used
 * special applications such as multi track hard disk recorders to find out
 * the initial setup. However the user should be able to override this
 * selection.
 *
 * To find out which modes are actually supported the application should 
 * try to select them using SNDCTL_DSP_CHANNELS.
