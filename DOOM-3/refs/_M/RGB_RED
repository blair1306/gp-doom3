 * Ordering of RGB data in scanlines passed to or from the application.
 * If your application wants to deal with data in the order B,G,R, just
 * change these macros.  You can also deal with formats such as R,G,B,X
 * (one extra byte per pixel) by changing RGB_PIXELSIZE.  Note that changing
 * the offsets will also change the order in which colormap data is organized.
 * RESTRICTIONS:
 * 1. The sample applications cjpeg,djpeg do NOT support modified RGB formats.
 * 2. These macros only affect RGB&lt;=&gt;YCbCr color conversion, so they are not
 *    useful if you are using JPEG color spaces other than YCbCr or grayscale.
 * 3. The color quantizer modules will not behave desirably if RGB_PIXELSIZE
 *    is not 3 (they don&apos;t understand about dummy color components!).  So you
 *    can&apos;t use color quantization if you change that value.
