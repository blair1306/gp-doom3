 * These macros provide the in-line portion of bit fetching.
 * Use CHECK_BIT_BUFFER to ensure there are N bits in get_buffer
 * before using GET_BITS, PEEK_BITS, or DROP_BITS.
 * The variables get_buffer and bits_left are assumed to be locals,
 * but the state struct might not be (jpeg_huff_decode needs this).
 *	CHECK_BIT_BUFFER(state,n,action);
 *		Ensure there are N bits in get_buffer; if suspend, take action.
 *      val = GET_BITS(n);
 *		Fetch next N bits.
 *      val = PEEK_BITS(n);
 *		Fetch next N bits without removing them from the buffer.
 *	DROP_BITS(n);
 *		Discard next N bits.
 * The value N should be a simple variable, not an expression, because it
 * is evaluated multiple times.
