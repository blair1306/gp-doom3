 * NV_CTRL_FLATPANEL_SCALING - the current flatpanel scaling state;
 * possible values are:
 *
 * 0: default (the driver will use whatever state is current)

 * 2: scaled (the driver will use the GPU&apos;s scaler, if possible)
 * 3: centered (the driver will center the image)
 * 4: aspect scaled (scale with the GPU&apos;s scaler, but keep the aspect
 *    ratio correct)
