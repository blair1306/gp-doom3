 * Each IDCT routine is responsible for range-limiting its results and
 * converting them to unsigned form (0..MAXJSAMPLE).  The raw outputs could
 * be quite far out of range if the input data is corrupt, so a bulletproof
 * range-limiting step is required.  We use a mask-and-table-lookup method
 * to do the combined operations quickly.  See the comments with
 * prepare_range_limit_table (in jdmaster.c) for more info.
