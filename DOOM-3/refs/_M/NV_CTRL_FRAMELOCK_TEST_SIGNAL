 * NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_TEST_SIGNAL - to test the connections in the sync
 * group, tell the master to enable a test signal, then query port[01]
 * status and sync_ready on all slaves.  When done, tell the master to
 * disable the test signal.  Test signal should only be manipulated
 * while NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC is enabled.
 *
 * The TEST_SIGNAL is also used to reset the Universal Frame Count (as
 * returned by the glXQueryFrameCountNV() function in the
 * GLX_NV_swap_group extension).  Note: for best accuracy of the
 * Universal Frame Count, it is recommended to toggle the TEST_SIGNAL
 * on and off after enabling FrameLock.
