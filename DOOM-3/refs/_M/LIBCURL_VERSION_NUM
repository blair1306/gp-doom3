<doc f='codebrowser/curl/include/curl/curl.h' l='34'>/* This is the numeric version of the libcurl version number, meant for easier
   parsing and comparions by programs. The LIBCURL_VERSION_NUM define will
   always follow this syntax:

         0xXXYYZZ

   Where XX, YY and ZZ are the main version, release and patch numbers in
   hexadecimal. All three numbers are always represented using two digits.  1.2
   would appear as &quot;0x010200&quot; while version 9.11.7 appears as &quot;0x090b07&quot;.

   This 6-digit hexadecimal number does not show pre-release number, and it is
   always a greater number in a more recent release. It makes comparisons with
   greater than and less than work.
