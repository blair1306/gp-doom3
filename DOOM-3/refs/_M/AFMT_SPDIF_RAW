 * S/PDIF raw format. In this format the S/PDIF frames (including all
 * control and user bits) are included in the data stream. Each sample
 * is stored in a 32 bit frame (see IEC-958 for more info). This format
 * is supported by very few devices and it&apos;s only usable for purposes
 * where full access to the control/user bits is required (real time control).
