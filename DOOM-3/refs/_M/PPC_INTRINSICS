<doc f='codebrowser/idlib/math/Simd_AltiVec.h' l='86'>// This assumes that the dest (and mixBuffer) array to the sound functions is aligned. If this is not true, we take a large
// performance hit from having to do unaligned stores
//#define SOUND_DEST_ALIGNED

// This assumes that the vertexCache array to CreateShadowCache and CreateVertexProgramShadowCache is aligned. If it&apos;s not,

// This turns on support for PPC intrinsics in the SIMD_AltiVec.cpp file. Right now it&apos;s only used for frsqrte. GCC 
// supports these intrinsics but XLC does not.</doc>
