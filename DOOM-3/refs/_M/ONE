 * Macros for handling fixed-point arithmetic; these are used by many
 * but not all of the DCT/IDCT modules.
 *
 * All values are expected to be of type INT32.
 * Fractional constants are scaled left by CONST_BITS bits.
 * CONST_BITS is defined within each module using these macros,
 * and may differ from one module to the next.
