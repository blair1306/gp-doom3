     Initializes the decompression dictionary from the given uncompressed byte
   sequence. This function must be called immediately after a call of inflate
   if this call returned Z_NEED_DICT. The dictionary chosen by the compressor
   can be determined from the Adler32 value returned by this call of
   inflate. The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same
   dictionary (see deflateSetDictionary).

     inflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (such as NULL dictionary) or the stream state is
   inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the given dictionary doesn&apos;t match the
   expected one (incorrect Adler32 value). inflateSetDictionary does not
   perform any decompression: this will be done by subsequent calls of
   inflate().
