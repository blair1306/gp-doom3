     Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.

     This function can be useful when several compression strategies will be
   tried, for example when there are several ways of pre-processing the input
   data with a filter. The streams that will be discarded should then be freed
   by calling deflateEnd.  Note that deflateCopy duplicates the internal
   compression state which can be quite large, so this strategy is slow and
   can consume lots of memory.

     deflateCopy returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream state was inconsistent
   (such as zalloc being NULL). msg is left unchanged in both source and
   destination.
