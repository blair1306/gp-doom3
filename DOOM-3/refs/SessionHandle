 * In August 2001, this struct was redesigned and is since stricter than
 * before. The &apos;connectdata&apos; struct MUST have all the connection oriented
 * stuff as we may now have several simultaneous connections and connection
 * structs in memory.
 *
 * From now on, the &apos;SessionHandle&apos; must only contain data that is set once to
 * go for many (perhaps) independent connections. Values that are generated or
 * calculated internally for the &quot;session handle&quot; must be defined within the
 * &apos;struct urlstate&apos; instead.  */</doc>
