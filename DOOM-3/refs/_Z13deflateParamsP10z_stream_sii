     This function is equivalent to deflateEnd followed by deflateInit,
   but does not free and reallocate all the internal compression state.
   The stream will keep the same compression level and any other attributes
   that may have been set by deflateInit2.

      deflateReset returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being NULL).
