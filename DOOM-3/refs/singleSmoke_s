===============================================================================

	Smoke systems are for particles that are emitted off of things that are
	constantly changing position and orientation, like muzzle smoke coming
	from a bone on a weapon, blood spurting from a wound, or particles
	trailing from a monster limb.

	The smoke particles are always evaluated and rendered each tic, so there
	is a performance cost with using them for continuous effects. The general
	particle systems are completely parametric, and have no performance
	overhead when not in view.

	All smoke systems share the same shaderparms, so any coloration must be
	done in the particle definition.

	Each particle model has its own shaderparms, which can be used by the
	particle materials.
