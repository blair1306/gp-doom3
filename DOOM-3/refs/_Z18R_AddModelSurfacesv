===================
R_AddModelSurfaces

Here is where dynamic models actually get instantiated, and necessary
interactions get created.  This is all done on a sort-by-model basis
to keep source data in cache (most likely L2) as any interactions and
shadows are generated, since dynamic models will typically be lit by
two or more lights.
